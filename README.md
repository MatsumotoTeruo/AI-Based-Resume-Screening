# AI-Based-Resume-Screening
# Introduction
AI Resume Screening is an artificial intelligence-powered solution that automates resume screening and shortlisting. The program analyzes resumes using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms and assigns them to job roles based on the words in the resume.

Our tool will be designed to make the hiring process easier for both HR teams and job seekers. Using pre-trained machine learning models trained on thousands of resumes, our platform automatically filters out resumes that do not meet the job specifications. Resumes are grouped based on job-related keywords and phrases. If a candidate's resume meets the job description, they are alerted instantly and their resume is added to the company's database. Even if a candidate's CV does not meet the description, it displays the potential role appropriate for the uploaded resume. 

Our tool saves HR teams valuable time and energy as they no longer need to sift through hundreds of resumes manually. Job seekers also benefit from receiving immediate feedback on their eligibility, streamlining their job search process.

# Features
Automated resume screening: AI Resume Screening saves time and effort by automatically screening resumes based on job requirements and pre-defined criteria.

Improved accuracy: The tool uses advanced algorithms to analyze resumes, reducing the likelihood of human bias and improving the accuracy of the shortlisting process. We have achieved 73 percent accuracy. 

# Usage
Final_Project.ipynb: It is the jupyter notebook which we used to train the final model on all algorithms. It also contains the accuracies of each algorithm we have used. I used the DistilBert model from Hugging Face to train the data.
